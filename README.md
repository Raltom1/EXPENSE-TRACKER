## 🛠️ Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### 🎯 `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
📂 Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  

🔄 The page will reload automatically when changes are made.  
⚠️ You may also see any lint errors in the console.

---

### 🧪 `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
📖 See more details [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

---

### 🏗️ `npm run build`
Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.  
✅ Optimized for best performance.  
💾 Filenames include hashes for versioning.  

Your app is ready to deploy! 🚀  
📖 See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more info.

### ⚙️ `npm run eject`
**⚠️ Warning: This is a one-way operation!**

Once you run `eject`, you cannot go back. This command will:  
- Remove the single build dependency.  
- Copy all configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.).  
- Give you full control of the setup.  

🔐 Use this command only if necessary. It is not required for small and medium projects.
